2. [Port](#port)
3. [Session Key](#key)
4. [Shell scripting](#scripting)


### Main
The code specified here will be executed on application start. The contents of this tag is Go code, it is located at the root of your GXML file. For example :

    <gos>
        ...

            fmt.Println("Logging from main function")   
        </main>
        ...
    </gos>

	func main(){
	    ...
	    fmt.Println("Logging from Main function")
	    ...
	}




### Port

	<gos>

	<gos>
	    ...
	    <key>my-key-braah</key>

### Scripting
Run terminal commands after your build is finished with the `<sh>` tag.
