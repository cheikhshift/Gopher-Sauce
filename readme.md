Gopher Sauce is is a command line tool used for compiling GoS projects. A GoS project uses XML sources to create a web server (one Go src file with package main). It uses xml to build onto Go lang's [template](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/)  processing functionality, making it easier to define custom objects,methods and structs that are accessible to your templates and even api endpoints for your web server.
Gopher Sauce makes web server application distribution easy by compiling your entire Gopher Sauce application's sources and misc. file resources into one binary. 

### How to install GoS
